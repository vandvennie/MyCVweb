## 🌐 Project Overview

This website was developed as the first assessment for **CITS5505**, focusing on best coding practices in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It demonstrates research into these best practices while providing an interactive experience for visiting web developers to reflect on their own coding approaches.

The project is fully implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, **without front-end frameworks** such as React, Vue, or Node. It also incorporates **Bootstrap** and **jQuery**, with customized CSS to ensure a unique and personal design. The website is composed of two distinct pages:

---

## 📄 Best Practices Page

* This page presents a **list of best coding practices** in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Each best practice includes:

  * A brief explanation of why it is recommended.
  * A checkbox for users to indicate whether they believe their own website adheres to that practice.
* **Local storage** is used to persist the user’s selections even after refreshing or closing the browser.
* A dynamic summary is displayed, showing how many best practices the user has selected.
* A **success metric** is defined (for example, achieving 12 out of 15 practices).
* When the user meets the success metric, an **AJAX request** retrieves a **random cute animal picture** from a public API
* This interactive feedback mechanism promotes engagement and highlights the importance of best practices.
